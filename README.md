# Node.JS Practice

## Setting up a simple server with Express.

1. Create a new directory to work in. In this case, it is "node-practice".
`mkdir node-practice`

2. Navigate to that working directory.
`cd node-practice`

3. Run the npm init command to begin creating your package.json file. You can skip through filling out the fields by pressing enter a few times, if you want.
`npm init`.

4. Install Express via npm.
`npm install express --save`

5. Create a file called index.js.
`touch index.js`, or if you like VIM `vim index.js`.

6. Setup the file as seen in index.js.

7. Once index.js is set up, run `node index.js` in the server directory, and navigate to localhost:5000 in your browser to check that it is running properly.
